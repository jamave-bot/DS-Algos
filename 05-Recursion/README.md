# Recursion

## Objectives

- Define what recursion is and how it can be useful
- Understand the two essential components of a recursive function
- Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
- Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems

## What is recursion? 
A **process** (a function in our case) that **calls itself**

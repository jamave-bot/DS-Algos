# Binary Search Trees

## Objectives
- Define what a tree is
- Compare and contrast trees and lists
- Explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
- Implement operations on binary search trees

## What is a Tree?
A data structure that consists of nodes in a **parent/child** relationship

![Tree data structure](./1.jpg)

(Doesn't have to be number data types, could be anything)

**Lists** - **Linear**

**Trees - Nonlinear**

![Not a tree structure, a graph](./2.jpg)

**This is not a tree because:**
- Nodes are referencing other nodes that aren't their children
- Nodes can't point to "sibling" nodes
- This is a **graph**

## Tree Terminology
- **Root** - The top node in a tree
- **Child** - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
- **Parent** - The converse notion of a child
- **Siblings** - A group of nodes with the same parent
- **Leaf** - A node with no children
- **Edge** - The connection between one node and another

## Uses for Trees

## Trees
Lots of different applications
- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Tree 
- Aritificial Intelligence
- Folders in Operating Systems
- Computer File Systems

## Intro to Binary Trees

## Kinds of Trees
- Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees

![Binary Tree](./3.jpg)

- Only ever has 2 children

![Not a Binary Tree](./4.jpg)
- This has 3 children

![Binary Search Tree or BST](./5.jpg)

## How BSTs (Binary Search Trees) Work
- Every parent node has at most **two** children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is **always less** than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent

## Searching a Binary Search Tree
The way a binary search tree is structured, it makes it very easy to look things up and insert things

---

## Our Tree Classes

```js
class Node {
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
    constructor(){
        this.root = null;
    }
}

var tree = new BinarySearchTree();
tree.root = new Node(10);
tree.root.right = new Node(15);
tree.root.left = new Node(7);
tree.root.left.right = new Node(9);
```

## BST Insert

## Psuedocode
(Iteratively or Recursively)
- Create a new node
- Starting at the root
    - Check if there is a root, if not- the root now becomes that new node!
    - If there is a root, check if the value of the new node is greater than or less than the value of the root
    - If it is greater
        - Check to see if there is a node to the right
            - If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps
            - If there is not, add that node as the right property
    - If it is less
        - Check to see if there is a node to the left
            - If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps
            - If there is not, add that node as the left property
- Return the tree at the end

(My attempt in index.js)

## BST Insert Solution

```js
class Node {
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
    constructor(){
        this.root = null;
    }
    insert(value){
        var newNode = new Node(value);
        if(this.root === null){
            this.root = newNode;
            return this;
        }
        var current = this.root;
        while(true){
            if(value === current.value) return undefined;
            if(value < current.value){
                if(current.left === null){
                    current.left = newNode;
                    return this;
                }
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                if(current.right === null){
                    current.right = newNode;
                    return this;
                } 
                current = current.right;
            }
        }
    }
}


//      10
//   5     13
// 2  7  11  16

var tree = new BinarySearchTree();
tree.insert(10)
tree.insert(5)
tree.insert(13)
tree.insert(11)
tree.insert(2)
tree.insert(16)
tree.insert(7)
```

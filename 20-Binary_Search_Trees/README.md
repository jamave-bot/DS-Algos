# Binary Search Trees

## Objectives
- Define what a tree is
- Compare and contrast trees and lists
- Explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
- Implement operations on binary search trees

## What is a Tree?
A data structure that consists of nodes in a **parent/child** relationship

![Tree data structure](./1.jpg)

(Doesn't have to be number data types, could be anything)

**Lists** - **Linear**

**Trees - Nonlinear**

![Not a tree structure, a graph](./2.jpg)

**This is not a tree because:**
- Nodes are referencing other nodes that aren't their children
- Nodes can't point to "sibling" nodes
- This is a **graph**

## Tree Terminology
- **Root** - The top node in a tree
- **Child** - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
- **Parent** - The converse notion of a child
- **Siblings** - A group of nodes with the same parent
- **Leaf** - A node with no children
- **Edge** - The connection between one node and another

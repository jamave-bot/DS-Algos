# Comparing Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort

| Algorithm | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity |
|-|-|-|-|-| 
| Bubble Sort| O(n) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1) |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1) |
| Selection Sort | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1) |

## Recap
- Sorting is fundamental 
- Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
- All have average time complexities that are quadratic
- We can do better... but we need more complex algorithms!
- These are better on smaller data sets

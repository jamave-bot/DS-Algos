## Introduction to Sorting Algorithms

### What is sorting? 

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order

e.g.
- Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
- Sorting names alphabetically
- Sorting movies based on release year
- Sorting movies based on revenue

```js
function sort(arr){
    return arr //where array is sorted
}

sort([23,45,6,12,13]) //[6,12,13,23,45]
```

### Why do need to learn this?
- Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works. 
- There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages

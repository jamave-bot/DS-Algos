# Merge Sort

More challenging, less intuitive, but much faster than the other algorithms. 

## Objectives
- Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned
- Implement merge sort
- Implement quick sort
- Implement radix sort

## Why learn this?
- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
- Try out bubble sort on 100000 elements, it will take way too long

## Faster Sorts
- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(*n*<sup>2</sup>) to O(*n*log*n*)
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand

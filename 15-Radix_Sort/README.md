# Radix Sort

## Introduction 

## Comparison Sorts

**Average Time Complexity**
- Bubble Sort - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Insertion Sort - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Selection Sort - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Quick Sort - O(nlog(n))
- Merge Sort - O(nlog(n))
Can we do better? 

Yes, but not by making comparisons

## **Radix Sort** 
Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers

It never makes comparisons between elements!

It exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits

More digits means bigger number!

## How does it work?

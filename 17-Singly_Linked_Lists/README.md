# Singly Linked Lists

## Introduction

## Objectives
- Define what a singly linked list is
- Compare and contrast linked lists with arrays
- Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on singly linked lists

## What is a **linked list**?
A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail**, and **length** property.

Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each **node** has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or null

## Comparisons with Arrays

**Lists**
- Do not have indexes
- Connexted via nodes with a **next** pointer
- Random access is not allowed

**Arrays**
- Indexed in order
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
